## Ultrapass Authenticator Introduction

The **Ultrapass Authenticator** provides a comprehensive solution for identity verification that leverages **homomorphic tokenization**, ensuring privacy and security at scale. Core features include:

1. **Secure User Registration**  
   - Users enroll by capturing biometric data (e.g., face, voice).  
   - All captured data is instantly transformed into **homomorphic tokens** on the device, so no raw biometric ever leaves the user’s device unencrypted.

2. **Passwordless Authentication**  
   - Eliminates traditional passwords, reducing risk of credential theft or phishing.  
   - Users simply present their biometric (face or voice) or use the on-device token to authenticate.

3. **Face Age Estimation**  
   - Confirms if a user is above a certain age threshold (e.g., 18+)—essential for regulated industries or content gating.  
   - Runs quickly on-device or server-side, protecting raw images with the same homomorphic tokenization approach.

4. **Ultrapass MediaSafe (Hosted Video Pipeline)**  
   - A secure end-to-end pipeline for recording and storing video evidence (e.g., identity-proofing sessions, liveness checks, additional user verification steps).  
   - Preserves privacy by encrypting data in transit and at rest, ensuring compliance with data protection laws.

5. **Photo ID Scanning & Comparison**  
   - Capture and analyze the portrait from a driver’s license, passport, or other photo IDs.  
   - Compare the ID portrait to the user in real time on-device, ensuring the highest level of privacy.  
   - Integrates with **IDEMIA** for extended IDV services (document identity verification, authenticity checks) to validate the integrity of the ID document.

## Repository Overview

This **GitHub** repository contains:

- **Pre-built Web Pages** (written with React.js, Material UI, and TypeScript):
  - Live instance at [https://cams.ultrapass.id/](https://cams.ultrapass.id/).
  - Integrate these pages into your own site for out-of-the-box identity verification workflows, or use them as a starting point for deeper customization.

- **React.js & Node.js/Express Code Examples**:
  - Demonstrates best practices for calling the Ultrapass Authenticator’s backend endpoints.  
  - Shows server-side logic for issuing verification sessions, handling callbacks, and retrieving results.

### Environment Variables

An `env.example` file is provided to illustrate the environment variables required. For local development or deployment:

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env

## Edit .env to Include Your PrivateID API Key

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATEID_API_KEY
```

### Security Note
Never commit your actual `.env` or secrets to version control.

## Configuration
Modify `src/config.ts` to adapt the verification workflow to your needs:

- **Session Timeout**: Define how long a verification session stays active.
- **Callback Endpoints**: Specify endpoints for asynchronous notifications (e.g., after a user finishes capturing data).
- **Branding and UI**: Adjust color palettes, logos, text, and disclaimers.
- **Enabled Biometric Flows**: Toggle face recognition, liveness checks, age estimation, or ID scanning.

## Using the Ultrapass Authenticator in Different Deployment Models

## How to Use PrivateID Software

### Register
1. **Capture & Tokenize**
   - User consents to biometric capture.
   - Biometric data transforms into a homomorphic token on-device.
2. **Backend Registration**
   - Application sends the token to PrivateID.
   - Service creates a user profile or merges tokens.
3. **Confirmation**
   - Success message returned with a unique user identifier (GUID)—no raw biometrics are stored.

### Passwordless Authentication
1. **Request Token**
   - User initiates sign-in, triggering a fresh biometric capture.
2. **Match & Verify**
   - Token submitted to PrivateID for matching.
3. **Grant Access**
   - If matched, user is authenticated.

### Face Age Estimation
1. **On-Device Model**
   - AI model estimates age range.
2. **Compliance**
   - Useful for content gating (18+ or 21+ verification).
3. **Integration**
   - Age check result is passed to the server or UI.

### Ultrapass MediaSafe Hosted Video Pipeline
- **Video Recording**: Short videos for identity proof or liveness detection.
- **Secure Upload & Storage**: Encrypted videos stored in PrivateID’s cloud or self-hosted solution.
- **Playback & Verification**: Authorized personnel review footage in a controlled environment.

## Attended vs. Unattended Use
- **Attended**: Operator supervises the verification (e.g., bank branches, event check-ins).
- **Unattended**: User verifies alone via app, kiosk, or webpage.

## Technical Explanation of PrivateID Homomorphic Tokenization
