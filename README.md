# Ultrapass Authenticator: Verified Identity by PrivateID

## Prebuilt Webpages with React.js, Material UI, and TypeScript

Welcome to the **PrivateID Verified Identity** repository! This resource provides front-end code for prebuilt webpages—created with **React.js, Material UI, and TypeScript**—to help you integrate PrivateID’s Ultrapass Authenticator into a wide variety of applications. These sample implementations serve as both a quick-start guide and a foundation for deeper customizations.

The **Ultrapass Authenticator** is a feature-rich identity platform that relies on **homomorphic tokenization**, an advanced cryptographic method that secures user data without ever exposing raw biometrics. Whether you need user verification for **e-commerce, mobile apps, access control, or kiosks**, Ultrapass Authenticator delivers seamless and secure experiences for both digital and physical scenarios.

## Introduction to the Ultrapass Authenticator
The **Ultrapass Authenticator** is the cornerstone of **PrivateID’s** modern user verification approach. It supports a variety of **biometric modalities** (face, voice, etc.) while using **homomorphic tokenization** to protect sensitive user details. Because raw data never leaves the user’s device unencrypted, privacy risks are dramatically reduced.

### Key Functionalities
- **Secure Registration** – Onboard new users quickly without exposing personal data.
- **Passwordless Authentication** – Eliminate password vulnerabilities and simplify login processes.
- **Face Age Estimation** – Comply with age-based regulations by verifying age thresholds.
- **Photo ID Scanning and Comparison** – Link government-issued IDs to live biometric checks.
- **Unattended Biometric Access Control** – Provide frictionless, staff-free entry to secure areas.
- **IDEMIA IDV Integration** – Add government ID authentication for rigorous identity verification.

## Overview of PrivateID Services
PrivateID offers various identity verification solutions, allowing flexibility in deployment:

### 2a. PrivateID Downloadable Software Services
- **For on-device processing:** Supports native **iOS, Android, and dedicated kiosks**.
- **Capabilities:** Biometric capture, liveness detection, ID scanning, and homomorphic token generation.
- **Use Cases:** Secure workforce check-ins, kiosk-based identity verification.

### 2b. PrivateID Online and SaaS Services
- **For cloud-based solutions:** PrivateID handles infrastructure, security, and compliance.
- **APIs/SDKs:** Easily integrate with existing systems.
- **Use Cases:** E-commerce logins, multi-factor authentication, workforce validation.

## Repository Explanation
This repository provides sample pages illustrating key **workflows**, such as registration, ID scanning, and biometric authentication.

### 3a. Environment Variables
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your **PrivateID API key**.
- **Do not** commit `.env` files or credentials to version control.

### 3b. Configuration
- Modify `src/config.ts` for branding, UI elements, session expiration, and verification modes.
- Customize legal disclaimers, localization, and compliance rules.

### 3c. Local Installation and Execution
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install

# Start local development server
npm run start  # Default: http://localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Deployment Options
### 4a. Mobile Apps (Downloadable Software)
- **Full hardware integration** (Face ID, Android Biometric Manager, Secure Enclaves).
- **Supports offline token generation** with cloud sync.

### 4b. Backend as SaaS (Hosted by PrivateID)
- **Minimal DevOps required** – plug in API keys and start verifying users.

### 4c. Backend as PaaS (Self-Hosted)
- **For enterprises with strict data regulations** – deploy on **Kubernetes or on-prem** infrastructure.

### 4d. WebAssembly Integration (Browser-Based)
- **No installation required**, identity verification directly in the **browser**.

### 4e. White Labeling and Customization
- Customize **logos, colors, disclaimers, and languages** to align with brand identity.

## Core Ultrapass Authenticator Use Cases
### 5a. Registering New Users
- Biometric input is converted into a **secure homomorphic token**.

### 5b. Passwordless Authentication
- Token matching authenticates users **without passwords**.

### 5c. Face Age Estimation
- Local age estimation **without transmitting raw images**.

### 5d. Ultrapass MediaSafe Hosted Video Pipeline
- Secure video storage for **legal, telehealth, and compliance applications**.

### 5e. Unattended Biometric Access Control
- Seamless access control using **face or voice biometrics**.
