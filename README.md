# PrivateID Verified Identity â€“ PreBuilt Webpages

Welcome to the **PrivateID Verified Identity** repository! This project houses front-end code for **pre-built web pages**â€”developed in **React.js**, **Material UI**, and **TypeScript**â€”that showcase how to integrate **PrivateID**â€™s homomorphic tokenization-based **Ultrapass Authenticator** into your applications.

The **Ultrapass Authenticator** is a comprehensive identity solution supporting:

- **Registration** (biometric capture and secure user onboarding)
- **Passwordless Authentication** (eliminates passwords with secure, on-device tokenization)
- **Face Age Estimation** (age checks to ensure compliance or content gating)
- **Ultrapass MediaSafe** (hosted video pipeline for secure media recording and verification)
- **Photo ID Scanning & Comparison** (capture driverâ€™s license, passport, or other IDs; compare the portrait to the user on-device)
- **Extended IDV Services** with **IDEMIA** (document authenticity and identity verification)
- **Unattended Biometric Access Control** for physical security (doors, turnstiles, and kiosks)

Depending on your requirements, you can deploy these capabilities in multiple ways:

- As **downloadable software** on mobile devices (iOS/Android apps)
- As a fully managed **SaaS** hosted by PrivateID
- As a **PaaS** in your own infrastructure (self-hosted or private cloud)
- Embedded in a webpage via **WebAssembly**, with **white-label** options to fit your brand

## Ultrapass Authenticator Introduction

The **Ultrapass Authenticator** is a multi-faceted identity verification platform that leverages **homomorphic tokenization** to ensure privacy and security at scale.

### Key Features:

1. **Secure User Registration**
   - Capture and tokenize biometric data (e.g., face, voice) during enrollment.
   - All raw data is immediately converted into **homomorphic tokens** on the userâ€™s device.
2. **Passwordless Authentication**
   - Eliminates passwords, preventing phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
3. **Face Age Estimation**
   - Quickly determines if a user meets a required age threshold (e.g., 18+).
4. **Ultrapass MediaSafe (Hosted Video Pipeline)**
   - Provides a secure pipeline for video evidence capturing, encrypting all transmissions.
5. **Photo ID Scanning & Comparison**
   - Scans and verifies government-issued IDs against real-time facial capture.
6. **Partnership with IDEMIA for IDV**
   - Extends document authenticity checks for greater verification security.
7. **Unattended Biometric Access Control**
   - Enables frictionless entry into physical facilities using biometrics.

## Technical Explanation of PrivateID Homomorphic Tokenization

### Core Concept:

- **One-Way Mapping:** Converts biometric data into high-entropy vectors.
- **Encrypted Operations:** Tokens retain structure for matching but cannot be reversed.
- **Token Properties:** Keyless, anonymized, irreversible, small in footprint (1KBâ€“16KB).

### Security & Cryptographic Layers:

- **Hybrid PKI & Time Salts** prevent replay attacks.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography** ensures future-proof security.
- **Immutable C++ Container** secures token generation and matching.
