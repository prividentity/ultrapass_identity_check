How to Use PrivateID Software (General Guidance)
Register
Capture & Tokenize

User consents to biometric capture (face, voice, or other).
Biometric data is transformed into a homomorphic token on-device in milliseconds.
Backend Registration

Your application or the pre-built pages send the token to the PrivateID verification service (SaaS/PaaS).
The service creates a new unique user profile or merges tokens with an existing user record.
Confirmation

A success message is returned with a unique user identifier (GUID) reference—no raw biometrics are ever stored.
Passwordless Authentication
Request Token

User initiates sign-in. A local or server-based module requests a fresh biometric capture.
The user’s face or voice is turned into a new token on the client side.
Match & Verify

The token is securely submitted to the PrivateID service for matching.
The service checks it against stored tokens for the user or performs a “1:few” search.
Grant Access

If the match is successful, the user is authenticated.
The system can generate a session token, JWT, or pass a success callback to your application.
Face Age Estimation
On-Device Model

Using a specialized AI model, the user’s face is quickly analyzed for an approximate age range.
The entire transformation from raw image to homomorphic token can incorporate age metadata.
Compliance

Perfect for gating content (e.g., verifying 18+ or 21+).
Reduces friction and risk of human error when manually checking IDs.
Integration

The result (“Over 18,” “Over 21,” or “Fails Age Check”) is passed to the server or rendered in your front-end UI.
All raw data is discarded after token generation.
Ultrapass MediaSafe Hosted Video Pipeline
Video Recording

Users can record or stream short videos for identity proof or advanced liveness detection.
The system can also record user steps during remote notary or compliance checks.
Secure Upload & Storage

Videos are encrypted in-flight using ephemeral session keys.
Stored in PrivateID’s secure cloud or your self-hosted solution if using PaaS.
Playback & Verification

Authorized personnel can review footage in a controlled environment.
Video-based workflows integrate seamlessly with the same token-based approach, preventing unauthorized leaks.
Attended vs. Unattended Use
Attended

An operator or staff member assists or supervises the user’s registration/verification.
Common in scenarios like bank branches, in-person support desks, or event check-ins.
Unattended

The user interacts with the system alone via a mobile app, kiosk, or webpage.
Suitable for around-the-clock identity checks, e-commerce logins, or large-scale user onboarding.
Technical Explanation of PrivateID Homomorphic Tokenization
Below is a detailed technical overview of PrivateID’s Homomorphic Tokenization (HT) Technology, adapted from our internal whitepaper and independent validation reports.

1. Introduction
Homomorphic tokenization (HT) underpins PrivateID’s secure approach to biometric data handling. This technique ensures data remains fully private by only allowing specific computations (like distance matching) on encrypted tokens.

2. Background and Motivation
From 2014 to 2018, improved biometric algorithms spurred widespread adoption. However, concerns about data misuse escalated, leading to stricter privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, BIPA). PrivateID’s R&D produced a neural network cryptography framework—nicknamed Cryptonets—to preserve privacy while retaining performance.

3. Core Concept: Homomorphic Tokenization Technology
3.1 Neural Network Cryptography in Cryptonets
One-Way Transformation

The raw biometric image (face, fingerprint, voice, etc.) is irreversibly mapped to a high-entropy vector.
No key pair is needed; the neural network itself performs a one-way function.
Supports Encrypted Operations

Because tokens contain structured numerical embeddings, distance comparisons (for matching) or approximate nearest neighbor searches become possible without decrypting or exposing raw data.
3.2 PrivateID Edge Encryption Service
Compiled C++ Library

Runs as a secure, immutable module on user devices or kiosk hardware.
Accessible via multiple language bindings (Swift, Kotlin, JavaScript/WebAssembly, Python).
Performance

Typical face image of ~5 MB transforms to a 1–16 KB token in ~20 ms, suitable for real-time use.
Matching single tokens or performing “1:few” searches also takes just a few milliseconds.
3.3 Token Properties: Keyless Anonymization
Keyless

There is no private/public key to lose or break; the mapping is effectively a function of the neural model.
Multi-layered

Homomorphic tokens can be combined or re-tokenized for additional obfuscation if needed.
3.4 Detailed Privacy and Encryption Mechanisms
Immutable Code

The C++ library is compiled with code obfuscation to hinder reverse engineering.
No raw biometric data is stored in memory after the token is generated.
Hybrid PKI and Session Management

Each session (for example, each verification attempt) uses ephemeral AES-256 keys.
TLS v1.3 is layered on top to protect data in transit.
4. Advantages Over Conventional Biometric Solutions
One-Way Anonymization

Eliminates the possibility of reconstructing a user’s face or fingerprint from stored data.
No Raw Data Storage

Dramatically reduces compliance and breach notification obligations.
Minimizes legal liabilities associated with storing PII.
High Performance

Token generation in ~20 ms, matching in ~5 ms.
Feasible for large-scale applications with millions of records.
Regulatory Peace of Mind

Tokens are recognized as anonymized data under IEEE 2410-2021.
Reduces or removes obligations under GDPR, BIPA, and similar regulations.
5. Security Framework and Cryptographic Layers
Immutable Container

All transformation logic is embedded in a compiled binary.
No external calls to convert tokens or retrieve raw data.
TLS v1.3 + Hybrid PKI

Ensures end-to-end encryption for token transmissions.
Ephemeral keys mitigate replay attacks or session hijacks.
Quantum-Resistant Design

The transformation does not rely on factorization-based cryptography.
Even quantum computers will find it exceedingly difficult to invert these neural embeddings.
6. Empirical Validation and Independent Testing
Independent Lab Tests

CITeR (Center for Identification Technology Research), Michigan State University, and other institutions have tested irreversibility claims.
ISO/IEC 24745 Compliance

Confirms that PrivateID tokens meet unlinkability and irreversibility requirements for biometric template protection.
Ongoing Audits

Routine penetration tests and security reviews underscore the system’s robustness.
7. Alignment with International Standards
IEEE 2410-2021

Certifies anonymization and fosters compliance with global privacy mandates.
ISO/IEC 24745

Focuses on biometric information protection, validating irreversibility and renewability.
NIST FIPS 140-3 and NIST SP 800-63

Ensures cryptographic modules meet federal security standards, including identity-proofing.
8. Technical Benefits
Guaranteed Biometric Privacy

A fundamental design principle: raw data never leaves the source in plain form.
High Throughput

Efficient “1:few” approach for large-scale identity checks or deduplication.
Scalability & Integration

Deploy across mobile devices, kiosks, servers, or web browsers using WebAssembly.
Offline/Edge Support

On-device models can handle age estimation and basic matching even without network access.
9. Future Research and Extensions
Encryption Doubling

Incorporation of additional layers of neural or noise-based obfuscation for advanced threat models.
Expanded Biometric Modalities

Beyond face, voice, and fingerprint, exploring palm prints, iris, or gait recognition.
Behavioral Signals

Potential to tokenize usage patterns or keystroke dynamics while preserving privacy.
Multi-Modal Authentication

Combining face + voice or face + palm for robust multi-factor authentication flows.
10. Conclusion
PrivateID’s homomorphic tokenization technology powers the Ultrapass Authenticator for secure, privacy-preserving, large-scale biometric identity solutions. It addresses the critical need for high accuracy, minimal overhead, and complete anonymity of user data.
